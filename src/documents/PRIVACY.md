#### This policy is current as of {date}.
{brand} is a product created by {company} (“{brand}”). We at {brand} know that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. 

By using or accessing the Services (“{brand}”) in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. You hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information outlined in this document.

The privacy of your data is important to us. We will only ever access your account to help you with a problem or fix a software bug. We’ll never open any private content such as “drafts,” “posts,” “tweets,” or “threads” unless you ask us to.
### The Information We Collect and Why
When you sign up or login to {brand} we collect information related to your X (formerly Twitter) account such as your X user ID, X screen name, and access keys for the X API. Why we collect this: We need these details for our X related services to function, and so that we can use X API functions on your behalf in order to provide our services on your X account.

We collect or process certain additional data contained in your X account (which could potentially contain sensitive data) where the functionality of the service we are providing requires it. This could include your posts. We only collect this type of data in order to provide a service you’ve asked us to by signing up. We’re careful to only hold it for as long as necessary, and the main purpose of the app is to allow you to you write, schedule, and publish posts or tweets.

We collect various information about visitors to our website due to our use of common internet technologies such as web server logs. These include details such as browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. We collect this information to understand how visitors use our websites, and to monitor and protect the security and stability of our websites.

For our in-app purchase flow, we collect related information such as payment amounts, times, and currencies to validate and secure payments. We also have a legal obligation to keep certain data for the purpose of tax calculation. We do not collect sensitive information such as credit card numbers as these are handled by Stripe, our payment processor.

{brand} uses third party services, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to provide our services. These are listed in the section “Processors we use” below. By using our services, you agree to the [X (formerly Twitter) Privacy Policy](https://x.com/en/privacy).
